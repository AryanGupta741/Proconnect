A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
This project proposes a mobile app for restaurants that streamlines the ordering and feedback process through a combination of features:

Barcode Scanning: Users can initiate the app by scanning a unique barcode displayed at their table, eliminating the need for manual table selection.
User Registration: Upon scanning the code, users register with their phone number and name, enabling order tracking and potential personalized service.
Menu Display: The app showcases the complete menu with categorized items (appetizers, main course, etc.) including descriptions, prices, and potentially images.
Interactive Ordering: Users browse the menu, add desired items to their basket, specify quantities, and provide any special instructions like extra toppings or cooking preferences.
Real-time Basket Management: The basket displays a running total and allows users to edit or remove chosen items for flexibility.
Secure Payment: Users proceed to a secure payment gateway to choose their preferred payment method (cash, card, digital wallets) and confirm the order.
Order Confirmation: A confirmation screen displays order details (items, quantities, total cost, estimated preparation time). The order is then transmitted to the kitchen staff.
Table Association: Staff assigns the order to the corresponding table number scanned earlier, ensuring accurate delivery.
In-App Feedback: While enjoying their meal, users can submit reviews and feedback directly through the app.
Order Completion: Once finished, users mark their order as complete, allowing the restaurant to archive it for future reference and analysis.
Overall, this project aims to enhance the restaurant dining experience by:

Offering a convenient and contactless ordering process through barcode scanning.
Providing users with a user-friendly interface to browse the menu, customize their orders, and manage their basket.
Enabling secure in-app payment options.
Facilitating real-time order tracking and confirmation.
Streamlining communication between customers and staff through table association.
Gathering valuable customer feedback to improve service and offerings.
This project presents a comprehensive solution for restaurants seeking to modernize their operations, improve customer engagement, and gain valuable insights through a mobile app platform.
